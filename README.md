# React Simple Router.

A Simple React Router that you can use on the server-side as well.

## Quick Overview

  - Simple router with named router parameters.
  - Seperated Navigation handling
  - Automagic link interception
  - Only HTML5 History API support for navigation
  - Falls back to "changing the page" for legacy (no attempt to use hash/query navigation)

## A Bit More Explanation

The lib is split into two parts: the `Router.Component` and the `Router.Navigator`.

The idea behind this is that we should always pass data in to our app from the top.
So the only singleton is the Navigator which will only be used client-side, where a
singleton is safe. On the server, navigate makes no sense and is stubbed out anyway.

The `Component` is a React Component used to build the structure for the app based
on URL. There are no `Route` sub-components, you define your routes and handlers as
an array of objects. The `Component` does not do any handling of changes to URL or
provide any help to navigation.

The `Navigation` is a module that provide 2 functions: `onNavigate` which is triggered
with the new `path` when a URL change happens and `navigate` used to trigger a change
or URL. `navigate(url, options)` takes an optional options object which so far only
looks for the key `replace` to be truthy. If `options.replace` is truthy then we
use `replaceState` instead of `pushState`.

The `Naivgation` also hooks in listener to intercept link clicks and perform the
navigation, so regular links Just Workâ„¢.


```javascript
var React = require("react"),
    Router = require("react-simple-router");

class NotFound extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return React.DOM.div(null, "Page Not Found: "+this.props.path);
  }
}

class PageOne extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return PageAny({pageNumber: 1});
  }
}

class PageAny extends React.Component {
  render() {
    var anotherPage = "/page/"+Math.floor(Math.random()*1000);

    return React.DOM.div(null,
      React.DOM.h1(null, "Page "+this.props.pageNumber+"! "),
      React.DOM.p(null, React.DOM.a({href: "/not_found_here" }, "404")),
      React.DOM.p(null, React.DOM.a({href: anotherPage }, anotherPage)),
      React.DOM.p(null, React.DOM.a({href: "https://google.com"}, "external link")),
      React.DOM.p({onClick: this.programmaticNavigate, style: { "cursor": "pointer" }}, "home (n.b. this is clickable)")
    );
  }

  programmaticNavigate(ev) {
    ev.preventDefault();
    Router.Navigator.navigate("/");
  }
}

var _routes = [
  { pattern:"/", handler: PageOne },
  { pattern:"/page/:pageNumber", handler: PageAny}
];

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return Router.Component({
      path: this.props.path,
      routes: _routes,
      notFound: NotFound
    });
  }
}

//now the wiring.
var app = React.renderComponent(App({ path: window.location.pathname }), document.body);

// This does the event binding needed, should be set to the same as the renderComponent root node
// you can call it without a node and it will bind to `window` (normal for full page routing).
// or you can not call it at all, and it will bind to `window`.
//Router.Navigator.setAppRoot(document.body);

//add our navigation logic.
Router.Navigator.onNavigate(function(newPath){
  app.setProps({ path: newPath });
});
```
